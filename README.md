This repository is the final project for JHU EN 600.439 Computational Genomics. Our project is implementing a novel method for doing error connection for genome sequencing data based on a probabilistic data structure - count-min sketch. Our implementation will provide a parallel computation support by Apache Hadoop 2.5.0.
